In this week, we will extend our dialogues on *learning theory* in Week 4 into deeper conversations about hidden assumptions in learning analytics. 

This line of thinking has been informed by a talk given by **[Simon Knight](https://twitter.com/sjgknight?lang=en)** at LAK13 titled <a href="//www.slideshare.net/sjgknight/lak13-knight-buckingham-shum-littleton-paper" title="LAK13: Epistemology, Pedagogy, Assessment and Learning Analytics" target="_blank">Epistemology, Pedagogy, Assessment and Learning Analytics</a> (see slides below). Their work has evolved over the years and one reading for this week is a book chapter with a set of provocations pushing us to think more about hidden assumptions.

I've [written about this topic as well, but in my mother tongue Chinese](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317586037_Unpacking_Learning_Analytics_An_Attempt_to_Tilt_the_Iceberg_jiexixuexifenxixueyiciqiaodongbingshandechangshi). To me, "Learning Analytics is like an iceberg. Its visible parts include materialized tools and observable activities, while its hidden parts comprise conceptualizations of learning, power relations in teaching and learning, and complex social, political and cultural intentions of education."  Catering to the Chinese audience, I drew on [the etymology of the character 数 ("number") in Chinese](http://vividict.com/WordInfo.aspx?id=3730) and explained how one of its ancient forms (below) is embedded with the meaning of punishing a woman for her "mistakes". I could not stop asking: to what extent is this original meaning still reflected in our use of numbers or data (数据) today? Which other assumptions and biases are built into our daily data practices in general and learning analytics in particular? How about other languages or cultures?

## Week 5 Readings


1. Knight & Buckingham Shum. (2017). [Handbook of Learning Anlaytics, Chpater 1](https://solaresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chapter1.pdf).
2. Perrotta, C., & Williamson, B. (2018). [The social life of Learning Analytics: cluster analysis and the “performance” of algorithmic education](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439884.2016.1182927). Learning, Media and Technology, 43(1), 3–16.

As we work towards forming our SIGs and WGs, it would be great to think about making *some of* your annotations more useful for your group projects. I encourage each group to come up with a group tag, e.g., `#SIG_social_network`, `#WG_recommender_system`. By doing so, we will be able to index our ideas as we continue to engage with all sorts of resources. 

As I explained in our Zoom meeting last week, you will be able to drag and drop your Hypothesis annotations into Knowledge Forum when you collaboratively work on your projects. The following animation gives you some sense about the process, but you can also drag an annotation directly into a note you're editing.

## SIG and WG Project Planning

First of all, **please finalize your Working Group (WG) and Special Interest Group (SIG) choices.**  Feel free to ask questions on Slack.

If you have assembled a group, congratulations! As for next steps, I suggest you consider the following when launching your SIG and WG efforts:

- On Knowledge Forum, create a new *view* dedicated to your group (SIG or WG). You can configure your view to be private, protected, or public. 
- In your WG view, start crafting your project idea. You can copy earlier discussions over or start from scratch. Use it as a shared workspace to organize your work. Of course, you can use other tools like Google docs. But one benefit of using KF is it is less linear and interface with Hypothesis. 
- In your SIG view, start planning the session you will lead. Feel free to reach out to Bodong for reading suggestions. 


## Housekeeping

Our next virtual meeting will take place on **Monday, Oct 7, 5-6:30pm** via Zoom. You should have received a Calendar invitation with details.
