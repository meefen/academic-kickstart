In this week, we will extend our dialogues on *learning theory* in Week 4 into deeper conversations about hidden assumptions in learning analytics. 

This line of thinking has been informed by a talk given by **[Simon Knight](https://twitter.com/sjgknight?lang=en)** at LAK13 titled <a href="//www.slideshare.net/sjgknight/lak13-knight-buckingham-shum-littleton-paper" title="LAK13: Epistemology, Pedagogy, Assessment and Learning Analytics" target="_blank">Epistemology, Pedagogy, Assessment and Learning Analytics</a> (see slides below). Their work has evolved over the years and one reading for this week is a book chapter with a set of provocations pushing us to think more about hidden assumptions.

I've [written about this topic as well, but in Chinese](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317586037_Unpacking_Learning_Analytics_An_Attempt_to_Tilt_the_Iceberg_jiexixuexifenxixueyiciqiaodongbingshandechangshi). To me, "Learning Analytics is like an iceberg. Its visible parts include materialized tools and observable activities, while its hidden parts comprise conceptualizations of learning, power relations in teaching and learning, and complex social, political and cultural intentions of education."  Catering to the Chinese audience, I drew on [the etymology of the character 数 ("number") in Chinese](http://vividict.com/WordInfo.aspx?id=3730) and explained how one of its ancient forms (below) is embedded with the meaning of punishing a woman for her "mistakes". I could not stop asking: to what extent is this original meaning still reflected in our use of numbers or data (数据) today? Which other assumptions and biases are built into our daily data practices in general and learning analytics in particular?

## Week 5 Readings


1. Knight & Buckingham Shum. (2017). [Handbook of Learning Anlaytics, Chpater 1](https://solaresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/chapter1.pdf).
2. Perrotta, C., & Williamson, B. (2018). [The social life of Learning Analytics: cluster analysis and the “performance” of algorithmic education](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439884.2016.1182927). Learning, Media and Technology, 43(1), 3–16.

To make *some of* your annotations more useful for FROG activities, you can consider the following when making annotations this week:

- Consider ideas that are **helpful for growing your general knowledge of learning analytics**, and tag them with `GoodPoints`
- Consider ideas that are **helpful for a specific project of yours**, and tag them with `UsefulPoints`
- Consider annotating __"muddy points" in an article__ that you want to know more about, and tag them with `MuddyPoints`

These prompts are proposed in response to feedback we discussed in Week 4. Feel free to leave any thoughts as we've been doing in the class.

## Housekeeping

**Please finalize your Working Group and Special Interest Group choices.**  Feel free to ask questions on Slack.
