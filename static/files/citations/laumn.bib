  abstract  = "In recent years, a wide array of tools have emerged for the
               purposes of conducting educational data mining (EDM) and/or
               learning analytics (LA) research. In this article, we hope to
               highlight some of the most widely used, most accessible, and
               most powerful tools available for the researcher interested in
               conducting EDM/LA research. We will highlight the utility that
               these tools have with respect to common data preprocessing and
               analysis steps in a typical research project as well as more
               descriptive information such as price point and
               user-friendliness. We will also highlight niche tools in the
               field, such as those used for Bayesian knowledge tracing (BKT),
               data visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis.
               Finally, we will discuss the importance of familiarizing oneself
               with multiple tools?a data analysis toolbox?for the practice of
               EDM/LA research.",
