Over the past few weeks, we have explored multiple dimensions of Learning Analytics -- *ethical*, *epistemological*, *conceptual/theoretical*, *pedagogical*, *technical* -- and have devleoped nuanced understanding of this field.  Bringing together perspectives from distinctive disciplines into meaningful conversations takes time. I'm proud of our collective work so far in the community!

## Week 7 Plan and Resources

This week, we will make use of what we've learned so far **to identify and analyze cases/examples of learning analytics applications**. 

### Two talks

Before we dive into identifying and analyzing cases, I want to share two talks that are related to this week and the projects you are working on. 

The first talk was given by **Prof. [Stephanie Teasley](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/stephanie-teasley)** from the University of Michigan, a powerhouse of learning analytics research & practice. She is a past president of SoLAR and has been leading various learning analytics efforts at UMich, including the __*My Learning Analytics (MyLA)*__ project to be rolled out at UMN. Her talk, titled "**Learning Analytics: Data Science for Education**", covers many grounds including analytics tool design and evaluation.

The second talk was an *ACM TechTalk* delivered by **Prof. [Joseph Konstan](http://konstan.umn.edu/)** from our own University of Minnesota. This talk, titled "**Recommender Systems: Beyond Machine Learning**", is more technical and of special interest to those of you interested in adaptive learning and educational recommender systems. Below are the slides [in PDF]. To watch the talk, you will need to fill out the registration form near the bottom of [this ACM page](https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&referrer=&eventid=2087659&sessionid=1&key=0321266D048A6229BB85D34C4BB1FC66&regTag=&sourcepage=register), which will direct you to a recorded webinar.

### Case analysis

After watching these videos, please conduct a learning analytics *case analysis* following these two main steps. 

#### 1: Identify

Ideally, you will **identify minimally one case/example** pertinent to your Working Group project. 

I am providing only a few examples below but you should absolutely go beyond this list. 

- Course Signals: [EDUCAUSE article](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2010/3/signals-applying-academic-analytics), [LAK12 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kURsmrkdS04)
- ECoach: http://ai.umich.edu/portfolio/e-coach/
- Academic Writing Analytics: https://utscic.edu.au/tools/awa/
- My Learning Analytics (MyLA): https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/my-learning-analytics-help/home
- Yellowdig visualization tool: https://vimeo.com/169580885

#### 2. Analyze

When analyzing a case/example, please consider the following aspects:

| *Aspects of the project*           | *Your analysis* |
|------------------------------------|----------|
| Name and links                     |          |
| Context and stakeholders           |          |
| Project goals                      |          |
| Learning constructs                |          |
| Data sources                       |          |
| Data analysis/mining techniques    |          |
| Actions suggested or taken         |          |
| Ethical considerations             |          |

To contribute your analysis, please **make a Hypothesis `Page Note` on a webpage about the analyzed case/example**. Not sure how to make a Page Note? See the screenshot below or the [help page](https://web.hypothes.is/help/quick-start-guide/) for details. Of course, you can make regular Hypothesis annotations as well when engaging with the web document. As always, **you are strongly encouraged to use `WG` or `SIG` related tags** so that your annotations are informing your evolving projects. You are also encouraged to comment on each other's analysis.

*Pro Tip*: You can copy-and-paste the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) code below to make a table in your annotation. The number of characters betwee each pair of `|`s won't matter.

```markdown
| Aspects of the project/application | Analysis |
|------------------------------------|----------|
| Name and links                     |          |
| Context and stakeholders           |          |
| Project goals                      |          |
| Learning constructs                |          |
| Data sources                       |          |
| Data analysis/mining techniques    |          |
| Actions taken or suggested         |          |
| Ethical considerations             |          |
```



## Housekeeping for Formal Participation

Since we've finalized our **Working Group and Special Interest Group plans**, please make use of Knowledge Forum, Slack channels, and other collaboration tools to coordinate with each other. 

Group project is never easy! [**UMN has some very useful tips** to make sure your group project will not look like "the zombie apocalypse"](https://teamwork.umn.edu/). 

Have a great week!
