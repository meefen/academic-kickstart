Let's be clear, *ethics* should not be an after-thought in a learning analytics application. But what do ethical practices in the field entail is not always clear. 

While research ethics considers principles such as confidentiality, privacy, and informed consent, a learning analytics project may not be considered *research* at all (if its goal is not to produce generalizable knowledge). However, extensive collection of learning data, increasing cases of "black-box algorithms," and more direct impact on learners necessitate some serious conversations about ethics in learning analytics.

Last week's discussions have already touched upon many questions about ethics. This week, we are going to dive into ethics, algorithmic accountability, and system integrity.

## Meet Learning Analytics Experts

**[Paul Prinsloo](https://opendistanceteachingandlearning.wordpress.com/about/)** from the University of South Africa (Unisa) has been writing and giving talks about 'ethics and learning analytics' for many years. He has recently delivered a keynote on this topic in Scotland. He has graciously allowed me to embed his slides on our course website:

**[Simon Buckingham Shum](http://simon.buckinghamshum.net/)**, Director of the Connected Intelligence Centre (CIC) at the University of Technology Sydney, invited us to consider 'Algorithmic Accountability' and 'Analytic System Integrity'. Discussion of Algorithmic Accountability has been [taken up by important academic associations like the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/public-policy/2017_usacm_statement_algorithms.pdf). But Simon stretches our thinking to consider 'Analytic System Integrity' in learning analytics. Below is a talk he gave at the UCL Institute of Education in 2016. His team is recently working on [Ethical Design Critique](http://simon.buckinghamshum.net/2018/08/ethical-design-critique/), which offers concrete measures to enhance ethics in learning analytics tools. (And he is scheduled to visit UMN this October! Details soon.)

## "Living" with Learning Analytics

Last week, we introduced [**CROWD LAAERS**](https://crowdlaaers.org/) designed for Hypothes.is.

This week, I encourage you to explore KF's list of analytic tools (see below) that can be accessed via the **Assessment** button. They are developed by colleagues from various countries. Note that we're using the newest version of KF and colleagues are still revamping many of these analytic tools based on earlier versions. So they are not always user-friendly. If you have ideas that can make them better, consider turning your ideas into a course project and I will try to connect you with the right colleagues to realize your ideas.

### Continuing to Consider Groups

**Please continue to explore and articulate your Working Group project ideas.** Please consider *problems/goals*, *stakeholders*, *data sources*, *analysis*, and *action* of your project. Continue to comment on each other's ideas on KF and don't be shy about saying "Our ideas are like cousins. Let's team up."

**Please start to consider which Special Interest Group(s) you're interested in.** Below is a list of tentative topics but you can suggest topics beyond the list. Ideally, the Special Interest Group you sign up for is related to your Working Group project.

- Social Network Analysis
- Predictive Models
- Text and Discourse Analytics
- Visual Learning Analytics
- Temporal Analytics
- Institutional Readiness

<!-- **Finally, whenever there is any interesting article, please either annotate using Hypothesis or share via Slack.** -->

### Virtual Meeting

Our next virtual meeting will take place on **Monday, 09/23, 5-6:30pm** via Zoom. You will receive a Calendar invitation with details.
