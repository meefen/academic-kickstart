As a sister field of Learning Analytics, **Educational Data Mining (EDM)** emerged a few years earlier and has its own disciplinary identity (e.g., a stonger computer science focus, its own [professional society](http://educationaldatamining.org/about/), [conference](http://educationaldatamining.org/conferences/), and [journal](https://jedm.educationaldatamining.org/index.php/JEDM)). While two communities developed separately in the beginning, [communication and collaboration between two communities (PDF)](http://www.upenn.edu/learninganalytics/ryanbaker/LAKs%20reformatting%20v2.pdf) have increased over the years. 

The overlaps and differences between two communities are nicely summarized by [Siemens (2013)](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002764213498851):

> Where LA is more concerned with sensemaking and action, educational data mining  (EDM) is more focused toward developing methods for "exploring the unique types of  data that come from educational settings". Although the techniques used are similar  in  both  fields,  EDM  has  a  more  specific  focus  on  reductionist  analysis  (Siemens  &   Baker,  2012).  As  LA  draws  from  and  extends  EDM  methodologies  (Bienkowski,   Feng, & Means, 2012, p. 14), it is a reasonable expectation that the future development  of analytic techniques and tools from both communities will overlap.

We are diving into EDM this week by exploring its connections with LA and playing with various data mining tools used in both communities.

As we start to work on our SIGs and WGs, it would be great to think about making *some of* your annotations more useful for your group projects. I encourage each group to use your group tag, e.g., `#SIG_multimodal`, `#WG_recommender_system`. By doing so, we will be able to index our ideas as we continue to engage with all sorts of resources. 

Note: These tags need to used accurately (e.g. spaces and caps matter) in order to be nicely aggregated by Hypothes.is. 

## Housekeeping

### Projects

Since we've finalized **our Working Group and Special Interest Group plans**, please create channels on Slack, invite group members in, and create group workspaces on Knowledge Forum (KF). 

Let the party begin!

### Next meetings

I strongly encourage you attend the **Inaugural Learning Informatics Seminar on Oct 23**, featuring Simon Buckingham Shum.  [RSVP here](http://z.umn.edu/learning-info)! 

Our next virtual meeting will take place on **Monday, Oct 28, 5-6:30pm** via Zoom. You should have received a Calendar invitation with details.
