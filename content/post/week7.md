Over the past few weeks, we have explored multiple dimensions of Learning Analytics -- *ethical*, *epistemological*, *conceptual/theoretical*, *pedagogical*, *technical* -- and have devleoped nuanced understanding of this field.  Bringing together perspectives from distinctive disciplines into meaningful conversations takes time. I'm proud of our collective work so far in the community!

Thanks to information shared by Crystal, I attended a panel named "**Big Data and the Future of Social Research**" organized by [the College of Liberal Arts](https://cla.umn.edu/events/cla-time-past-time-present-time-future). Many points made by the panelists resonated with myself and are in line with what we've been discussing in the community. I especially appreciated panelists' thoughts on challenges with "big data" projects (my tweet below). I anticipate we will wrestle with these challenges as well in the next couple of weeks.

## Week 7 Plan and Resources

This week, we will make use of what we've learned so far **to identify and analyze cases/examples of learning analytics applications**. 

### 1: Identify

Ideally, you will **identify minimally one case/example** pertinent to your Working Group project. 

I am providing a few examples below but you should absolutely go beyond this list. 

- Course Signals: [EDUCAUSE article](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2010/3/signals-applying-academic-analytics), [LAK12 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kURsmrkdS04)
- ECoach: http://ai.umich.edu/portfolio/e-coach/
- Academic Writing Analytics: https://utscic.edu.au/tools/awa/
- Yellowdig visualization tool: http://sites.northwestern.edu/teachx2016/2016/01/26/gru/

### 2. Analyze

When analyzing a case/example, please consider the following aspects:

| *Aspects of the project*           | *Analysis* |
|------------------------------------|----------|
| Name and links                     |          |
| Context and stakeholders           |          |
| Project goals                      |          |
| Learning constructs                |          |
| Data sources                       |          |
| Data analysis/mining techniques    |          |
| Actions suggested or taken         |          |
| Ethical considerations             |          |

To contribute your analysis, please **make a Hypothesis annotation on a webpage about the analyzed case/example**.  Please be prepared to introduce the case during our Zoom meeting. Feel free to comment on each other's analysis.


*Pro Tip*: You can copy-and-paste the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) code below to make a table in your annotation. The number of characters betwee each pair of `|`s won't matter.

```markdown
| Aspects of the project/application | Analysis |
|------------------------------------|----------|
| Name and links                     |          |
| Context and stakeholders           |          |
| Project goals                      |          |
| Learning constructs                |          |
| Data sources                       |          |
| Data analysis/mining techniques    |          |
| Actions taken or suggested         |          |
| Ethical considerations             |          |
```



## Housekeeping for Formal Participation

Since we've finalized our **Working Group and Special Interest Group plans**, please create channels on Slack and invite group members in. 

Have a great week!
